Code in C++ 
This code helps people to understand how their investments will grow. A simple code that helps with math that no one wants to do to test how much they will make off an investment over a certain period of time with or without monthly deposits. I love how readable the result of this code is. It breaks down year by year exactly how much your investment grows both with and without monthly deposits. Not only that but it shows the end of year income for each year basically showing how much passive income was gained that year. Honestly, I could have made this code prettier. While it gets the job done and is incredibly readable presentation wise it is very bare bones. The most challenging part was absolutely getting the math to work as intended. I was able to overcome this by focusing hard on pemdas and remembering my order of operations. By making the code itself readable and following industry best practices this made all the difference in making my math work. I could easily go back and identify any hiccups that my code had without tearing my hair out. This style of coding will be exceptional practice for moving forward and creating more code. Making the code readable will assist all future projects. Anyone editing my code should be able to easily identify what parts do what and change them to be better.
